## AWS Database Migration Service Automation Framework

This Amazon Web Services (AWS) Quick Start deploys AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) Automation Framework on the AWS Cloud in about 30 minutes. This Quick Start is for users who currently do one of the following:

 - Separate AWS DMS migration tasks into full-load and change-data-capture (CDC) phases 
 - Require a fully automated code deployment framework that is repeatable and customizable

You can use this Quick Start as a building block in the entire migration process.

This deployment includes AWS CodePipeline, which isnâ€™t currently supported in all AWS Regions. For a current list of supported Regions, see [Service Endpoints and Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-service-information.html) in the AWS documentation.
